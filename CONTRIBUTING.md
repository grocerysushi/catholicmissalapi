3. **Liturgical Tests**: Verify liturgical calculations and rules
4. **Data Source Tests**: Test external data fetching (with mocks)

### Writing Tests:
```python
def test_easter_calculation_2024():
    """Test Easter calculation for 2024."""
    calendar = LiturgicalCalendar(2024)
    easter = calendar.easter_date
    assert easter == date(2024, 3, 31)  # Verify with official sources
```

### Test Data:
- Use real liturgical dates for verification
